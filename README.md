# VIGHR


A 3D printed Vascular Implant for Group Housed Rats.  This is an improved version of the implant for jugular catheter originally described in our <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00437/full#h1" target=_new> Front Behav Neurosci paper </a>.  The 'mesh' like base makes it much more stable than the previous version.
